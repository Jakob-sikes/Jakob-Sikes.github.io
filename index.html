                This 3D model set features two distinct tank variations, differing in weaponry and material
                        design while
                        maintaining the recognizable silhouette of a generic tank. Created in Blender for product
                        visualization,
                        the models use relatively low-poly construction to optimize performance while retaining visual
                        appealâ€”making
                        them versatile for both static renders and real-time applications. Bloom effects and dynamic

                        enhance
                        the presentation, emphasizing the differences in armament and material. Originally designed as a
                        standalone piece, one of the models was later integrated into my interactive comic project,
                        demonstrating its adaptability in different media.

                This animation depicts a malfunctioning machine tearing open a portal, pulling nearby boxes into
                        its swirling void. Shot from a static camera perspective, the scene focuses on the chaos
                        unfolding, with added camera shake to intensify the severity of the malfunction. Modeled and
                        textured in Blender, I utilized node shaders to create a dynamic portal illusion, enhanced by
                        keyframed rotations for a mesmerizing spinning effect. To push the animation further, I refined
                        it in DaVinci Resolve, applying additional effects to heighten the atmosphere and immersion.
                        This project was a personal exploration of visual storytelling and dynamic motion, blending 3D
                        animation with post-processing for a more polished and dramatic presentation.

                Created for a two-week game jam hosted by Boise State University's Game Dev and Design club, this
                    animation aimed to capture the immersive and foreboding essence of a Souls-like game. Using a
                    first-person perspective, the scene follows a lone wanderer navigating a fog-drenched, mysterious
                    town, evoking a sense of unease and discovery. Modeled and textured entirely in Blender, I used
                    keyframed animations for character movement and environmental interactions, enhancing the realism of
                    the experience. To refine the presentation, I brought the animation into DaVinci Resolve, where I
                    smoothed transitions, adjusted pacing, and applied subtle motion enhancements to deepen the
                    atmospheric tension. The final piece balances eerie visuals and fluid movement, immersing the
                    audience in a haunting world reminiscent of the Souls-like genre.

                    <p>In Spring 2024, our team created an interactive comic exploring the randomness of the universe
                        through branching narratives and minigames. The story follows an abstract character from
                        childhood to death, with pivotal choices drastically altering their journey. I contributed by
                        modeling and refining scenes in Blender, enhancing them in Photoshop, and rendering them in a
                        comic-style format for Unity. I also designed a maze minigame, symbolizing a critical decision
                        where players choose between an easy but unethical path or a difficult but moral one. A key
                        challenge was maintaining narrative cohesion across multiple branches while ensuring engaging
                        gameplay, which we solved through careful story mapping and iterative testing. This project

                    <p>In Fall 2023, our group developed an augmented reality (AR) game that combined a 2D Unity card game
                        with real-world Blender models as AR components. Players used digital cards to summon characters and
                        elements that appeared in the real world through AR. My role involved creating all artistic assets,
                        including the UI, 3D AR models (such as a farmer, soldier, raven, snake, and food), and 2D card
                        designs. A key challenge was ensuring seamless integration between 2D gameplay and AR interactions,
                        which required refining textures and optimizing models for performance. Working with AR introduced a
                        new level of complexity and immersion, transforming static cards into interactive experiences. This

                        soccer and game development. Using a pixel art style for its nostalgic charm, I focused on gameplay
